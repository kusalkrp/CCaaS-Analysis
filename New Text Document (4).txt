# Carbon Capture as a Service (CCaaS) Implementation Analysis Report

## Executive Summary:
The Multi-Site Factory's CCaaS initiative has been analyzed to evaluate its operational efficiency, financial viability, and environmental impact across its four factory sites. This report provides detailed insights into the current state of CCaaS implementation and offers strategic recommendations for optimization.


## 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Missing Values: 
  - There were missing values across several columns, notably in 'CO2_Captured_Tons', 'Operational_Costs', 'Energy_Consumption', 'Revenue_CO2_Sales', 'Revenue_Carbon_Credits', and 'Plant_Uptime_Percentage'.
  - These missing values were filled using mean values for numerical columns and mode for categorical 'Site_ID'.
  

## 2. Descriptive Statistics

- Outliers: 
  - No outliers were detected in the provided data for any of the numerical columns.
  
- Summary Statistics:
  - The mean CO2 captured across all sites ranged from 281.56 tons (Site_4) to 303.89 tons (Site_2).
  - Operational costs averaged around $3000 per site.
  - Customer satisfaction scores averaged around 5.5 across all sites, with a standard deviation indicating variability in scores.
  

## 3. Distribution Analysis

- Histograms and Boxplots: 
  - Detailed visual representations would typically accompany this section to show the distribution of each numerical variable. However, they were skipped in this text-based report.
  

## 4. Trend and Comparative Analysis

- Trends Over Time: 
  - The trend of CO2 captured showed fluctuations over time, with values ranging from 226.82 tons to 455.31 tons.
  
- Comparative Analysis by Site: 
  - Sites 1, 2, and 3 had similar mean CO2 capture values, while Site 4 lagged slightly behind.
  

## 5. Operational Efficiency Analysis

- Correlation Matrix: 
  - The correlation matrix showed weak correlations between most variables, indicating that they might operate independently of each other.
  

## 6. Financial Performance Analysis

- ROI and Profit Margin:
  - ROI was negative for all sites, indicating that the financial returns are not positive.
  - Profit margins were also negative, further highlighting the financial challenges of the CCaaS implementation.
  

## 7. Environmental Impact Assessment

- CO2 Reduction:
  - The total CO2 emissions reduced across all sites were approximately 148,930.43 tons.
  
- CO2 Savings Potential:
  - The CO2 savings potential was estimated to be around 148,930.43 tons.
  

## 8. Customer Satisfaction and Correlation Analysis

- Customer Satisfaction:
  - Customer satisfaction scores ranged from 1 to 10, with an average score around 5.5.
  
- Correlation with Net Profit:
  - The correlation between customer satisfaction and net profit was found to be 0.118, indicating a weak positive relationship.
